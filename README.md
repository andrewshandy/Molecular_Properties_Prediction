# Project implemented on the final stage of the Bootcamp organized by JetBrain and Higher School of Economics Saint-Petersburg
We predicted solubility of Molecules based on their SMILES represinations. Datasets were taken from here - http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1

As a baseline we used XGBoost
Then we applied Graph Convolutional Networks to that problem. After what we experimented with different combinations of data to achieve the minimum RMSE score on a test dataset.
